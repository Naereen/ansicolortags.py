TODOs for ansicolortags package
===============================

Passing to Python v3+
---------------------

* clean up the code
* make it fully pylint clean
* make it fully compatible with Python 3+
* republish it cleanly (on Pypi, doc on readthedocs.io and not pythonhosted.org)

Last time I tried, it was not OK :

* problem when converting with the ``2to3`` tool :

  * tab and space inconsistencies,
  * the :code:`except:` is durty,
  * the whole code is durty !

Other changes
-------------

1. Improve support of Windows.
2. Add automated tools.
