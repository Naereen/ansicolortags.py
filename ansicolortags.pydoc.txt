DESCRIPTION
    An efficient and simple ANSI colors module (and also a powerful script), with functions to print text using colors.
    https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/ansicolortags.py
    
    
    The names of the colors follow these conventions:
    
    * for the eight ANSI colors (:black:`black`, :red:`red`, :green:`green`, :yellow:`yellow`, :blue:`blue`, :magenta:`magenta`, :cyan:`cyan`, :white:`white`):
    
      + the name in minuscule is for color **with bold** (example ':yellow:`yellow`'),
      + the name starting with 'B' is for color **without bold** (example ':yellow:`Byellow`'),
      + the name starting with a **capital** letter is for the background color (example ':yellow:`Yellow`').
    
    * for the special effects (:blink:`blink`, *italic*, **bold**, :under:`underline`, negative), they might not always be supported, but they usually are:
    
      + the name in minuscule is used to turn *on* the effect (example 'i' to turn on italic),
      + the name starting in capital letter is used to turn *down* the effect (example 'I' to turn off italic).
    
    * for the other special effects (``nocolors``, ``default``, ``Default``, ``clear``, ``el``), the effect is **immediate** (and seems to be well supported).
    
    
    List of functions
    =================
    
    To print a string
    -----------------
    
    * :py:func:`sprint`: give a string,
    * :py:func:`printc`: like :py:func:`print`, but with interpreting tags to put colors. **This is the most useful function in this module !**
    * :py:func:`writec`: like printc, but using any file object (and no new line added at the end of the string).
    
    To clean the terminal or the line
    ---------------------------------
    
    * :py:func:`erase`: erase all ANSI colors tags in the string (like sprint, but erasing and not interpreting color tags),
    * :py:func:`clearLine`, :py:func:`clearScreen`: to clear the current line or screen,
    * :py:func:`Reset`: to return to default foreground and background, and stopping all *fancy* effects (like blinking or reverse video).
    
    Others functions
    ----------------
    
    * :py:func:`notify`: try to display a *system* notification. **Only on GNU/Linux with notify-send installed.**
    * :py:func:`xtitle`: try to set the *title* of the terminal. Warning: **not always supported**.
    
    
    Example of use (module)
    =======================
    
    To store a string, use :py:func:`sprint` (i.e. print to a string, *sprint*), like this: ::
    
        >>> example = sprint("France flag is <blue>blue<white>white<red>red<white>, Italy flag have <green>green on it<white>.")
        >>> example
        'France flag is [01;34mblue[01;37mwhite[01;31mred[01;37m, Italy flag have [01;32mgreen on it[01;37m.'
    
    
    The string ``example`` can then be printed, with colors, with: ::
    
        >>> print(example)  # Sorry, but in the documentation it is hard to show colors :)
        France flag is bluewhitered, Italy flag have green on it.
    
    
    To directly print a string colored by tags, use :py:func:`printc` (colors will be there if you try this in your terminal): ::
    
        >>> printc("Batman's costum is <black>black<white>, Aquaman's costum is <blue>blue<white> and <green>green<white>.")
        Batman's costum is black, Aquaman's costume is blue and green.
    
    
    .. seealso::
    
       This is the most useful function. To do the same, but on any file, use :py:func:`writec`.
    
    
    Moreover, the function :py:func:`erase` can also be useful to simply delete all *valid* color tags: ::
    
        >>> print(erase("Batman's costum is <black>black<white>, Aquaman's costum is <blue>blue<white> and <green>green<white>, and this is a non-valid <tag>, so it is kept like this."))
        Batman's costum is black, Aquaman's costum is blue and green, and this is a non-valid <tag>, so it is kept like this
    
    
    In this last example, an ``<el>`` tag (:py:data:`el`) is used to erase the current content of the line, useful to make a *dynamical* print: ::
    
       >>> writec("<red>Computing <u>len(str(2**562016))<reset>...."); tmp = len(str(2**562016)); writec("<el><green>Done !<reset>")
       Done !
    
    The first part of the line 'Computing len(str(2**562016))....' have disappeared after the computation! (which takes about one second).
    
    
    Example of use (script)
    =======================
    
    * To show the help :code:`$ ansicolortags.py --help`;
    
    * To run a test :code:`$ ansicolortags.py --test`;
    
    * To produce a `GNU Bash color aliases file <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/.color.sh>`_ :code:`$ ansicolortags.py --generate --file ~/.color_aliases.sh`.
    
    
    Auto detection
    ==============
    
    This script can normally detect if ANSI codes are supported :
    
      1. ``$ ansicolortags.py --help`` : will print with colors if colors seems to be supported;
      2. ``$ ansicolortags.py --help --noANSI`` : will print without any colors, even if it is possible;
      3. ``$ ansicolortags.py --help --ANSI`` : will force the use of colors, even if they seems to be not supported.
    
    And, the module part behaves exactly like the script part.

FUNCTIONS
    Reset()
        Reset() -> unit
        
        **Try to** reset the current ANSI codes buffer, using :py:data:`reset`.
    
    clearLine()
        clearLine() -> unit
        
        **Try to** clear the current line using ANSI code :py:data:`el`.
    
    clearScreen()
        clearScreen() -> unit
        
        **Try to** clear the screen using ANSI code :py:data:`clear`.
    
    erase(chainWithTags, left='<', right='>', verbose=False)
        erase(chainWithTags, left='<', right='>', verbose=False) -> string
        
        Parse a string containing color tags, when color is one of the previous define name,
        and then return it, with color tags **erased**.
        
        Example:
        
          >>> print(erase("<blue>This is blue.<white> And <this> is white.<red> Now this is red because I am <angry> !<reset>"))
          This is blue. And <this> is white. Now this is red because I am <angry> !
        
        This example seems exactly the same that the previous one in the documentation, but it's not (it is impossible to put color in the output of a Python example in Sphinx documentation, so there is **no color in output** in the examples... but be sure there is the real output !).
        
        .. warning:: This function can mess up a string which has unmatched opening and closing tags (``<`` without a ``>`` or ``>`` without a ``<``), use it carefully.
    
    notify(msg='', obj='Notification sent by ansicolortags.notify', icon=None, verb=False)
        notify(msg='', obj='Notification sent by ansicolortags.notify', icon=None, verb=False) -> bool
        
        Notification using :py:mod:`subprocess` and ``notify-send`` (GNU/Linux command-line program).
        Also print the informations directly to the screen (only if verb=True).
        
        .. warning::
        
           This does not use any *ANSI escape* codes, but the common *notify-send* GNU/Linux command line program.
           It will probably fail (but cleanly) on Windows or Mac OS X.
        
        - Return True if and only if the title have been correctly changed.
        - Fails simply if ``notify-send`` is not found.
    
    printc(chainWithTags, *objects, **kwargs)
        printc(chainWithTags, *objects, left='<', right='>', sep=' ', end='\n', erase=False, **kwargs) -> unit
        
        Basically a shortcut to ``print(sprint(chainWithTags))`` : it analyzes all tags (i.e., it converts the tags like ``<red>`` to their ANSI code value, like :py:data:`red`), and then it prints the result.
        
        Example (in a terminal the colors, and the bold and underlining effects would be there):
        
        >>> printc("<reset><white>Â« <u>Fifty shades of <red>red<white><U> Â» could be a <green>good<white> book, <b>if it existed<B>.")
        Â« Fifty shades of red Â» could be a good book, if it existed.
        
        
        It accepts one or more "things" to print, exactly like :py:func:`print`: for each value ``arg_i`` in ``*objects``:
        
         - if ``arg_i`` is a string, it is converted using ``sprint(arg_i, left=left, right=right)`` (:py:func:`sprint`), and then passed to :py:func:`print`.
         - otherwise ``arg_i`` is passed to :py:func:`print` without modification (in the same order, of course).
        
        Example with more than one object:
        
        >>> print("OK n =", 17, "and z =", 1 + 5j, ".")
        OK n = 17 and z = (1+5j) .
        >>> printc("<green>OK<white> n =<magenta>", 17, "<white>and z =<blue>", 1 + 5j, "<reset>.")  # in a terminal, the output will have colors:
        OK n = 17 and z = (1+5j) .
        
        
        This is the more useful function in this package.
        
        - If ``erase = True``, then :py:func:`erase` is used instead of :py:func:`sprint`
        
        .. hint::
        
           I suggest to use `ansicolortags.py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansicolortags>`_ in your own project with the following piece of code:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               try:
                   from ansicolortags import printc
               except ImportError:
                   print("WARNING: ansicolortags was not found, disabling colors instead.\nPlease install it with 'pip install ansicolortags'")
                   def printc(*a, **kwargs):
                       print(*a, **kwargs)
        
        
        .. hint::
        
           During the last 4 years, `a lot of the small Python scripts I wrote <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/>`_ try to use this module to add some colors:
           for example, `FreeSMS.py <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/FreeSMS.py>`_,
           `plotnotes.py <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/plotnotes.py>`_,
           `strapdown2html.py <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/strapdown2html.py>`_,
           `calc_interets.py <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/calc_interets.py>`_...
    
    sleep(...)
        sleep(seconds)
        
        Delay execution for a given number of seconds.  The argument may be
        a floating point number for subsecond precision.
    
    sprint(chainWithTags, left='<', right='>', verbose=False)
        sprint(chainWithTags, left='<', right='>', verbose=False) -> string
        
        Parse a string containing color tags, when color is one of the previous define name,
        and then return it, with color tags changed to concrete ANSI color codes.
        
        **Tags are delimited** by ``left`` and ``right``.
        By default, it's `HTML / Pango style <https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html>`_ whit '<' and '>', but you can change them.
        
        For example, a custom style even closer to HTML could be: ``left='<span color='`` and ``right = '</span>'`` is also possible.
        
        .. warning::
        
           It is more prudent to put nothing else than ANSI Colors (i.e. values in :py:data:`colorList`) between ``'<'`` and ``'>'`` in ``chainWithTags``.
           The behavior of the function in case of false tags **is not perfect**.
           Moreover, a good idea could be to try not to use '<' or '>' for anything else than tags.
           I know, it's not perfect.
           But, the syntax of color tags is so simple and so beautiful with this limitation that you will surely forgive me this, *won't you* ;) ?
        
        
        Example (where unknown tags are left unmodified, and the colors should be there): ::
        
            >>> print(sprint("<blue>This is blue.<white> And <this> is white.<red> Now this is red because I am <angry> !<green><white>"))
            This is blue. And <this> is white. Now this is red because I am <angry> !
        
        
        This function is used in all the following, so all other function can also use ``left`` and ``right`` arguments.
    
    tocolor(mystring)
        tocolor(mystring) -> string
        
        Convert a string to a color.
        ``mystring`` **have** to be in :py:data:`colorDict` to be recognized (and interpreted).
        Default value if ``mystring`` is not one of the color name is ``""`` the empty string.
    
    writec(chainWithTags='', out=<open file '<stdout>', mode 'w'>, left='<', right='>', flush=True)
        writec(chainWithTags="", out=sys.stdout, left='<', right='>', flush=True) -> unit
        
        Useful to print colored text **to a file**, represented by the object ``out``.
        Also useful to print colored text, but without any trailing '\n' character.
        
        In this example, before the long computation begin, it prints 'Computing 2**(2**(2**4)).....',
        and when the computation is done, erases the current line (with ``<el>`` tag, :py:data:`el`),
        and prints ' Done !' in green, and the result of the computation: ::
        
             >>> writec("<red>Computing<reset> 2**(2**(2**4))....."); tmp = 2**(2**(2**4)); writec("<el><green>Done !<reset>")
             Done !
        
        
        This example show how to use this module to write colored data in a file.
        Be aware that this file now contains ANSI escape sequences.
        For example, :code:`$ cat /tmp/colored-text.txt` will well print the colors, but editing the file will show *hard values* of escape code: ::
        
            >>> my_file = open('/tmp/colored-text.txt', mode = 'w')  # Open an random file.
            >>> write("<blue>this is blue.<white>And <this> is white.<red>Now this is red because I am <angry> !<green><white>", file = my_file)
            >>> # Now this file '/tmp/colored-text.txt' has some ANSI colored text in it.
        
        Remark:
        It can also be used to simply reinitialize the ANSI colors buffer, but the function :py:func:`Reset` is here for this: ::
        
            >>> writec("<reset>")
        
        
        .. warning::
        
           The file ``out`` **will be flushed** by this function if ``flush`` is set to ``True`` (this is default behavior).
           If you prefer no to, use ``flush=False`` option: ::
        
               >>> writec(chainWithTags_1, out=my_file, flush=False)
               >>> # many things...
               >>> writec(chainWithTags_n, out=my_file, flush=False)
               >>> my_file.flush()  # only flush here!
    
    xtitle(new_title='', verb=False)
        xtitle(new_title="", verb=False) -> 0 or 1
        
        **Modify the current terminal title**.
        Returns 0 if one of the two solutions worked, 1 otherwise.
        
        An experimental try is with **ANSI escape code**,
        if the simple way by calling the ``xtitle`` program does not work (or if it is not installed).
        
        .. note::
        
           The second solution simply uses the two *ANSI* Tags ``<title>`` (:py:data:`title`) and ``<bell>`` (:py:data:`bell`).
           So, you can also do it with: ::
        
               >>> ansicolortags.writec("<title>This is the new title of the terminal<bell>")
        
        
        But this function *xtitle* is better: it tries two ways, and returns a signal to inform about his success.
