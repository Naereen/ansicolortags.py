Installation
------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project is entirely written in Python, version 2.7.3.
For more details about the Python language, see `the official site <https://www.python.org/>`_.
Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+ is required.

How to install it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is three different ways:

1. Directly, with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It can be installed with ``pip``: ::

    pip install ansicolortags

On GNU/Linux, it might be necessary to give it sudo rights: ::

    sudo pip install ansicolortags


2. Download, extract, and use setup.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Or you can also :

 1. download the file, `from PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansicolortags>`_;

 2. extract it (with :code:`tar xzfv`, or a graphical solution, like File Roller);

 3. then go in the subdirectory (:code:`cd ansicolortags-v0.1/`);

 4. and finally with Python distutils setup tool:

    .. code:: bash

       $ python setup.py install

    Or maybe with sudo rights, if the first try did not work :

    .. code:: bash

       $ sudo python setup.py install


3. Without installing it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that installation *is not mandatory* :
a third solution is to simply include JUST the file ``ansicolortags.py``,
and embed it in your own projects.
The project can be used without installing *anything elsewhere*.
