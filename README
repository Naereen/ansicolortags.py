``ansicolortags``
=================

[ansicolortags, a Python script and module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansicolortags) to simply and efficiently use ANSI colors in a command line Python program.
[![ansicolortags in pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ansicolortags.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansicolortags)

The ``ansicolortags`` module provides an efficient and useful function
(``printc``) to print colored text in a terminal application with Python 2 and 3, with a *HTML-tag* like style:

```python
from ansicolortags import printc  # Import the function
# ...
printc("France flag is <blue>blue<reset>, <red>red<reset>, and <white>white<reset> !")
```

will print the text *"France flag is blue, white and red !"* with appropriate colors (if the output supports them -- a terminal should but a file or a pipe should not).


All ANSI colors code are defined with this *HTML-tag like style*: ``<blue>``, ``<red>`` etc.
**This point is the main interest of this module,**
because all others modules define function to print with some colours.

For instance, the screenshot below shows the module begin used to print a colored text (the help of the script) which looks like this:
